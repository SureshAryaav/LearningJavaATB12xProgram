Increment and Decrement Operators
🧠 What Are They?
Increment (++) increases a variable’s value by 1.
Decrement (--) decreases a variable’s value by 1.

🧮 Syntax and Types
Both come in two forms:

1. Pre-Increment / Pre-Decrement :The variable is updated before it's used in the expression.
++x; // pre-increment
--x; // pre-decrement

2. Post-Increment / Post-Decrement: The variable is used in the expression before it's updated.
x++; // post-increment
x--; // post-decrement

📊 Comparison Table
Expression	What Happens	Final x	Value Assigned
x = 5; y = ++x;	x becomes 6, then assigned to y	6	6
x = 5; y = x++;	y gets 5, then x becomes 6	6	5
x = 5; y = --x;	x becomes 4, then assigned to y	4	4
x = 5; y = x--;	y gets 5, then x becomes 4	4	5

⚠️ Things to Remember
++x and x++ both increase x, but return different values.
Using x++ or ++x multiple times in a single expression (like x++ + ++x) can lead to undefined behavior in C/C++.
These operators can also be overloaded in object-oriented languages like C++.
