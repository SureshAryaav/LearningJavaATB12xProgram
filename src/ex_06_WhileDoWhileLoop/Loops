üîπ 1. What Are Loops?
Loops let you execute a block of code multiple times, reducing code duplication.

1Ô∏è‚É£ for Loop ‚Äì used when number of iterations is known
2Ô∏è‚É£ while Loop ‚Äì used when the condition is evaluated before entering
3Ô∏è‚É£ do-while Loop ‚Äì executes at least once, condition checked after

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes
Infinite loop due to missing i++ or wrong condition
while (true) without a break
Forgetting braces {} for multiple lines

Q: Difference between for and while loop?
for: best when you know how many times to loop
while: better when the condition depends on logic at runtime

Q: When does a do-while loop execute even if the condition is false?
A: Always executes once before checking the condition.

üîÅ What Are Nested Loops?
A nested loop means a loop inside another loop. The inner loop runs completely every time the outer loop runs once.

Q1: What is the time complexity of nested loops?
A: O(n^2) if both inner and outer loop run n times.

Q2: Can we use different loop types together (e.g., for + while)?
A: Yes, nested loops can mix for, while, and do-while.
